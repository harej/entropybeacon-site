This is a very basic listing app for the Entropy Beacon.

## Deploy your own listing

1. `git clone https://github.com/harej/entropybeacon-site`
2. Open `index.html` and look for `var pubkeys`. Replace the included pubkeys with those of your preferred beacons. Save.
3. Upload the entire folder to Skynet using https://siasky.net. Be sure to select the "upload folder or web app" option.
